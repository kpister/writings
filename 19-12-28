Moments of my last decade.

Life has a lot of little moments that we forget as they pass, and with time,
even the big moments fade out. As the decade closes, I want to look back on some
of the stand out moments and events, which I might otherwise forget in the years
to come.

To the best of my ability I would also like to document what I remember mattered
to me.

In some ways, this is my autobiography of the last decade... Strange.

2009-10:
Eight grade. 
My final year of middle school was a great year for me. 
My friend group had been well formed for two years. 
I spent most of my days talking to friends on Google Hangouts. 
In Spring I was playing Ultimate. 
This was the year I broke my right forearm (while playing Ultimate).
I enjoyed woodshop class.
I thought I would grow up and teach middle school math or physics.
In physics, we built bridges out of toothpicks - mine was par. 
I had a crush on Linda and we danced together at a couple of school dances.

2011-12:
High school sophomore year
This was the last year of Odyssey of the Mind.
My braces came off, and I was finally allowed to eat honey mustard onion
pretzels again.
I made a goal to bike and run 1000 miles in 100 days. Between the 6 mile bike
ride to school, cross country and Ultimate I didn't think this would be too
challenging, until...
I sprained my right ankle playing Ultimate. After two or three weeks, I jumped
back into my challenge and succeeded right on schedule.
I got my driver's permit (immediately after my birthday). This opened up my
social life, since I could start to spend most days at Chris Tennent's house
after school.
First got exposed to programming. Used Python for chatbots, and tried to learn
C++ but couldn't find a compiler/explanation of how to actually write code.
(Learned my father doesn't know _everything_.)
Dated Sofia, then decided 2012 would be a year without dating.
Played a lot of Guild Wars 2.

I wrote the first essay I enjoyed on Hamlet. It was a two page exploration of a
single quotation which completely ignored the prompt.
I did a WISE project, which consisted of journaling my second semester and doing
independent study (I took a cybersecurity class at UC Berkeley and "interned" at
TweedleTech).
My family took a 14 day cruise around Italy as my first exposure to Europe.
I was a TA for the AP CS class - started to think this computer stuff might be
interesting.
College apps consumed fall semester for my friends, but I (practically) only
applied to UCSD.

Played way too much League of Legends.
