Truth 
n.  
The quality or state of being:
1. In accordance with fact or reality
2. Accurate or exact

Charles Hockett describes 13 (later 16) fundamental design features of any full
language.
9 of the original 13 are found in primates' (and some unexpected animals')
interactions, while the other four are unique to humans.
Some of these features are quite obvious: 
To have a language, there must be a channel on which to communicate. Often
that is a vocal/auditory channel, but it could just as easily be visual/written,
or physical/visual.
To have a language, meaning must be tied to the sounds, symbols or actions
of the language. We would not be able to communicate if there did not exist some
understanding of meaning between speaker and listener.
Less obvious are features like Interchangeability, Displacement, and
Prevarication.
In order:
    Interchangeability describes the idea that any member of a language
community can convey any part of the language regardless of the veracity of the
statement. For example, I can easily say "I am in Spain" at the same time as "I
am in Russia." Neither are correct, there is not an inherent linguistic
restriction preventing me from saying either one. This feature is not seen in
some animal languages. Ant queens secrete a unique chemical compound to express
meaning to the hive, since no other ants can synthesize that compound, there is
not interchangeability in the ants' communication. This feature is the
embodiment of a lack of authentication. Our ability to communicate falsehoods
(by meaning) stems from the lack of authentication needed to create a statement.
If we communicated with pheromones like the ants do, it might be impossible for
me to say "I am female" since the language itself restricts my ability to
deceive. *rough*
    Humans are special in that we can discuss concepts and topics of distant or
imaginary content. It is with no difficulty that a reader can imagine an
elephant parading while wearing a small hat, despite having most likely never
actually seen one in real life. Displacement is our ability to address these
things not in our physical presence. There are some animals which have the
ability to "relay" displaced information, for example howler monkeys have been
observed sharing warning cries from other monkeys despite not being in the
physical presence of danger itself, however displacement in the general sense is
thought to be unique (on Earth) to human languages.
    Finally, Prevarication (literally "a violation of duty" from Latin) is the
ability to lie. Built on the idea of no language level authentication and
displacement, it is possible for anyone to speak false about anything --
regardless of direct connection or the speaker's real knowledge.

The discussion and motivation up to this point in my writing has not been
subtle. Deception in our language is inherent in its design; being a
(programming) language enthusiast(?), this flaw is hard for me to accept. So I
would like to examine what our language could look like under different
circumstances. A world without Interchangeability, Displacement, Prevarication
or some combination of those.


Future points:

It is easy to believe the world we interact directly with; there is no doubt
that the chair you are sitting in is as real as you are.




What if we need a new language for communication -- a language that has
authentication, privacy, integrity and confidentiality (the four pillars of
security).
There are two definitions of authentication which could be used here. First,
that it is possible to authenticate that a message came from the expected
sender. This is the traditional sense of authentication used in computer
science. A second, stronger restriction could be placed on the language
requiring that the content of a message must be verifiable of the sender. This
goal is most likely not attainable due to the complexity of what we need to
discuss in language. As described above, displacement is a necessary feature of
language -- without it we would hardly be different than chimpanzees in
linguistic ability.
