A short entry on design.

Tending a fire can be a difficult task. Knowing when to poke, condense or scrape logs takes experience and isn't intuitively obvious. However, there exists an interesting phenomenon around fire tending. As a cold ambitious person-near-fire approaches the flame to improve the flame (by whatever means), they are immediately warmed from the increased proximity to the source. Without actually improving the fire at all, simply by changing their own position, they believe they have already succeeded in their original task. Whether or not the fire warms, to the actor, there is an obvious improvement.

This phenomenon is mirrored in design. As designers approach a task, by simply observing and placing themselves closer to the problem at hand, have distorted their view of the problem. Without improving a UI, or analyzing a workflow, the designer has gained understanding which takes the problem towards its solution. The work done by the designer, similar to the fire, may not make any difference to others using the product despite the designer feeling that they have done everything necessary to succeed.
