Writing process

This is my writing process. It is a flawed workflow. Something I am looking to improve and iterate upon with more practice.

1. Idea floats to mind
    This can happen spontaneously or as a reaction to something I've read to experienced. A lot of the pieces I am most interested in are from the first category, but occasionally I feel the urge to write a reaction piece.
2. Make a note on my phone
    All of the topics I write about come from notes on my phone. Often I'll write a single line, maybe on a complex topic I'll add in a few lines of description to describe why I thought the thought or what circumstance I was in so that I can recreate the scene mentally as I write. 
3. Begin writing from stream of conciousness on my laptop in Vim. 
    For the most part I start with a title and write what comes to my mind as it comes to my mind striving for the goal of just putting thoughts to the page over creating something readable. I see this process as analogous to the memory urn that Dumbledore uses in Harry Potter. I am putting my wand to my head and extracting a thought - much better than I would ever do internally.

There are a couple steps I would like to add to this process.
The most important stages I am missing are steps 4,5, and 6 which are all "Editing." From the start I've been meaning to review past writings and iterate upon them, fixing confusing ideas, clarifying what would otherwise be seen as random connections. Rephrasing awkward sentencing and the like.
I also want to add a step between 2 and 3 which would be planning. I think that a lot of these pieces have almost just become the planning stage, but they would all benefit from a more structured guideline, a roadmap. That said, I do enjoy the stream of conciousness style of writing and would keep it for the outlining phase or even some full pieces. 

The limiting factor for me feels like time. I don't have the time to always be editing or planning pieces. I normally spend at most 15 minutes a day writing if I even get to that, but I think that in order to progress it is a necessary investment.

Writing is undoubtedly worth it. I am sure I'll feel the same about editing (especially because I often enjoy editing more than writing itself).
