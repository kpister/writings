I like writing privately. There is a sense of serenity that comes with knowing no one other than a very select selected few will get to see these words.
But I post this publicly to Github for anyone in the world to read. You might say, "But Kaiser, no one will read this." Which is fair, I expect the average viewer count per piece written here to be under one (myself included). 
Part of the enjoyment for me is the public exploration of my mind. I am not ashamed of my flaws, I recognize them, and attempt to improve upon them but only from a self improvement point of view. 
My writing ability, for example, has always been a weakness - I know this is a flaw of mine and it was something I used to be ashamed of, but that didn't get me anywhere! My shame prevented me from writing instead of pushing me to write more.

I have been ashamed of my appearance. I've had perpetual acne since I was 13, and while I never gave it too much thought it has always been a detriment to my personal image. But my shame around acne got me nowhere. Acceptance is what has brought me to the dermatologist. Acceptance is what brings change. 
I'm done letting my fear drive me. 

That is why I am writing publicly. I want to confront my fear of other people's judgement head on.
