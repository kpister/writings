Random Musings of the past month

Since I have hardly written in the past month, I've instead collected ideas and
questions I would like to explore in future writings.
I don't have the knowledge or the developed ideas to expand on these ideas yet,
but I want to put them down to ponder later.
Ideally, this will be an extension of the notepad I keep on my phone with one or
two sentences.

1. I don't want to reinvent the wheel but I do want to see why the wheel was
invented.
Most all of my true knowledge stems from an understanding of fundamental
ideas and problems.
    When I see what was, understanding what _is_ becomes much more intuitive. 
    Every step we take forward is often quite clear and logical, but when viewed
from 5,000 feet, the path becomes difficult to follow.
Our schooling primarily follows a structure that requires students to
believe something works because that's the way it is.
There is little chance to explore _how_ ancient scientists and
mathematicians discovered their works.
I believe a paradigm shift in schooling towards _how_ would dramatically
improve comprehension and excitement in school.
Students would have the opportunity to experience learning as a discovery
not as rote memorization.
Imagining history as though you were there to make the choices would imbue
students with not only a greater understanding of the difficulties people of
previous times went through but a greater sense of empathy towards those around
them today.

2. The benefits of indexing knowledge versus knowing knowledge.
Today we have the greatest index ever available to humankind in the form of
Google.
Provided you have access to the Internet, the average human can answer
almost any question.
This is undoubtedly an improvement over the past - there are plenty of
cognitive science question to be asked here, but you are hard pressed to argue
that wider spread access to knowledge is a bad thing.
More interesting to me is my own (and by extension others') educational
practices.
    Should I focus on learning an index on the material I read and interact with
such that I would be able to quickly find the answers that I need, or should I
focus on retaining exact details from that same content.
The obvious advantage of indexing would be a compression of knowledge down
to a single point of access.
Provided I have access to whatever material I have identified contains the
answer to my question, and I have the time to locate the answer in that
material, I only need a small amount of mental space to capture the idea.
On the other hand, retaining the entire idea in my head may take more space
but require significantly less time (an no direct resource requirement) to
access.
Furthermore, I would argue that having the knowledge in your head often
means that you have a stronger grasp of the ideas or have wrestled with them
beyond a first pass.
An encyclopedia is of course a wonderful tool, but that is not the point of
human thought.
    We live our lives to be critical thinkers solving complex, deep problems. 
The shallow form of thought that indexing promotes is hardly useful to that
end.
*Except* in trying to form connections between different ideas. Being able
to see a lot of small endpoints (indices) from a zoomed out view would certainly
make connecting large graphs of knowledge much easier. Conversely, deep
knowledge of few topics would be easier to connect a smaller graph.

3. I want to create a content recommendation system.
    This is not a project for other people so much as for myself. 
It would provide a way for me to track the things I am enjoying and reflect
on them in the same space.
Similar to this writing project, I think it would expand my borders to
something new.
    And who knows, maybe someone would benefit from it. 
My idea would be to review books or podcasts, tv shows, games, programming
languages, food. Anything that I interact with one a regular basis and have an
opinion on.

I'll leave this entry here. The rest of these thoughts will be filled in at a
later date.
The ideas mentioned here will hopefully be expanded into full pieces at some
point.
