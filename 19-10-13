The Power of Words

I have so many thoughts. My mind, like so many others is constantly full of
ideas and... stuff, but that has never been reflected in my output.
These thoughts that are going through me are transient and ephemeral. They show
up and disappear without leaving any impact. Rare is the idea that sticks so
fiercely inside me as to actually be verbalized or actuated. But now that I have
been writing these ideas down, they are trapped. So many more are getting stuck.
They have the power to make a change in the way that I act.
Writing gives this to me.

I'm curious why. Why can't my thoughts manifest properly in my head alone? Why
can't I changed based on something so short lived? Would it make a difference if
I expressed myself verbally to the extent I do now in writing?

A piece of the puzzle:
In my head, my thoughts are a single step down a path - one car of a train you
might say. And I allow them to remain that way. In my head, I do not pull
thoughts to fruition while on the page I do. Writing something down, lets you
look at it from a different perspective.


Entry 2 in Life Guide:
Push your boundaries. Find the things that are outside your comfort zone and do
them until they are in your comfort zone. Rinse, repeat.
- I plan to visit bars (not breweries) when I have time. I'll order a drink
and either find conversation or bring a small notebook and handwrite at the bar.
