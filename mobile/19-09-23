## Entry #1 in Life Guide by
Kaiser

I intend the following to be a
method of documenting the
parts of my life that
are working or have worked
well for me in the past. Our
lives are continually a
evolving and becoming more
complex and ever more full.
Finding time to do each
of the following will aid in
creating balanced schedule. To
the best of your
abilities, follow the
prescribed routine.

### Duolingo
Work towards a language every
day. Spend a minimum of 10
minutes speaking, and
writing reading.
- Practice something
completely new, don't follow
up on a language you in A
learned high school. language
with a new alphabet or at
least from a different
linguistic family is
preferred. The joy of learning
comes from finding new of
pieces knowledge and you'll
quickly tire from being told
to relearn something
you already know.

### Physical Workout
- Do a minimum of 15 pushups
every morning.
The difference between 0 and
15 is surprisingly large, and
by doing *some*
you'll feel much better than
doing none.
- Find a social physical
activity to do at least once a
week.
From experience rock
climbing and Ultimate are
great options

### Social Activities
- Spend at least one night
every week going out and
talking with people outside
of work.
Be ready with a list of
activities that would be fun
with a group or solo.
Some ideas in this space are
Frisbee Golf, Bowling...

### Scheduled Events
- Try to find consistent
events that will get you out
of the house. These will
keep you moving.
    Magic the Gathering nights
are a perfect example of a
weekly scheduled event
.

### Writing
The most important part of a
day is writing. The content of
your writing does
not particularly matter,
however the act of expressing
yourself to the external
world is one of the most
theraputic experiences.
Writing helps foster growth of
regardless the stage of your
life.
- Suggestions: if you are
having a difficult time
writing consistently, try
to find a time everyday when
to set aside for writing. I
find mornings are for
easiest this. If you are
having a hard time thinking of
what to write, browse a
the news for five minutes and
choose topic from there. Write
your own version,
however that may look.
