# Titles are dying with the
next generation

While the previous generations
place large importance on it
their titles and to
distinctions, has become much 
more socially appealing as a
display yourself
humble commoner.
We try to be the cool kids,
and don't seek to elevate the
ourselves above those
without same title.
Actions speak far louder than 
words in the age when can be
everything displayed.
 
Historically, the only way to 
convey one's prestige was the
through of others,
acknoledgement being knighted 
and graduation were testiments
 from a trusted you
organization that passed some 
set of qualifications. These
titles show that in
others believe you.
Now that anyone can publicly
display everything they can do
 online, it is much
less important to have from
testiment others.
The titles become irrelevant. 
Your credibility comes from
your actions and not others.
Reputation will be earned, not
 given. 

This is a good thing. A future
without titles leads to and
greater equality of
better treatment all, not just
those who were fortunate to
enough find someone
to bestow a title.
In some ways this will be the 
democratization of prestige.
The Internet allows
for a proof of competency.

However, with this idea comes 
the same set of issues present
 with all other of
benefits the Internet. We can 
lie, trick, and confuse larger
 masses of people
through the information found 
on the web.
One solution around this is a
Content Curation as Service
(CCaaS), which looks
to find reputable information 
and disseminate that to much
followers the same as
 news of the 20th century did.
 These CCaaSs provide specific
 insights into what 
they believe to be relevant,
and often provide brief or
descriptions reasoning
behind each topic mentioned.
This solution circles back to 
the current title'd approach. 
We will delegate to 
certain establishments or to
people do our fact checking,
and accredidation for
us, to save us the work of it
doing ourselves.
This is effectively transfer
the burden of titling to these
 CCaaSs, as opposed
to Universities or monarchs.
Despite this, we will still a
potentially have big
win. It is significantly for
easier multiple CCaaSs to a
accredit single author,
painter, thinker than for we
multiple universities. Drawing
 upon ideas from as
distributed systems, can see
this attempting to find among
consensus multiple a
sources instead of single
monolithic source.
Familiar to some, the Stellar 
Consensus Protocol allows for 
an individual who a
trusts some small subset of
all CCaaS to establish on the
consensus of source
creditability through quorum
slices of the whole network of
 CCaaS.

It is at this point that I see
 I have diverged significantly
 from the original
idea of the writing session,
but can't help but to think a
this is legitimate
idea.
