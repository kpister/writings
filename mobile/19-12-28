Moments of my last decade.

Life has a lot of little
moments that we forget as they
pass, and with time,
even the big moments fade out.
As the decade closes, I want
to look back on some
of the stand out moments and
events, which I might
otherwise forget in the years
to come.

To the best of my ability I
would also like to document
what I remember mattered
to me.

In some ways, this is my
autobiography of the last
decade... Strange.

2009-10:
Eight grade. 
My final year of middle school
was a great year for me.
My friend group had been well
formed for two years.
I spent most of my days
talking to friends on Google
Hangouts.
In Spring I was playing
Ultimate.
This was the year I broke my
right forearm (while playing
Ultimate).
I enjoyed woodshop class.
I thought I would grow up and
teach middle school math or
physics.
In physics, we built bridges
out of toothpicks - mine was
par.
I had a crush on Linda and we
danced together at a couple of
school dances.

2010-11:
High school freshman year
I had my first kiss.
The Odyssey of the Mind group
went to State level with two
new members.
I thought I would grow up and
teach biology, I wanted to
study marine biology.
Started taking Latin and
realized language is quite
interesting.

2011-12:
High school sophomore year
This was the last year of
Odyssey of the Mind.
My braces came off, and I was
finally allowed to eat honey
mustard onion
pretzels again.
I made a goal to bike and run
1000 miles in 100 days.
Between the 6 mile bike
ride to school, cross country
and Ultimate I didn't think
this would be too
challenging, until...
I sprained my right ankle
playing Ultimate. After two or
three weeks, I jumped
back into my challenge and
succeeded right on schedule.
I got my driver's permit
(immediately after my
birthday). This opened up my
social life, since I could
start to spend most days at
Chris Tennent's house
after school.
First got exposed to
programming. Used Python for
chatbots, and tried to learn
C++ but couldn't find a
compiler/explanation of how to
actually write code.
(Learned my father doesn't
know _everything_.)
Dated Sofia, then decided 2012
would be a year without
dating.
Played a lot of Guild Wars 2.

2012-13:

Ultimate was a big part of my
life. I spent most of my time

trying to wrangle together at
least 8 people to show up to
practices and
tournaments.
Prom with Megan (late because
of Ultimate tourney).
Taught Ultimate to middle
schoolers in Spring.
Worked at book store as a

started to actually program.
In the Summer, I spent a week
in the Porous NanoSilicon Lab
at UCSD.

2013-14:
High school senior year
Started dating Madeleine.
I wrote the first essay I
enjoyed on Hamlet. It was a
two page exploration of a
single quotation which
completely ignored the prompt.
I did a WISE project, which
consisted of journaling my
second semester and doing
independent study (I took a
cybersecurity class at UC
Berkeley and "interned" at
TweedleTech).
My family took a 14 day cruise
around Italy as my first
exposure to Europe.
I was a TA for the AP CS class
- started to think this
computer stuff might be
interesting.
College apps consumed fall
semester for my friends, but I
(practically) only
applied to UCSD.
President of the Ultimate
team.
Played way too much League of
Legends.
