Charles Hockett describes 13
(later 16) fundamental design
features of any full
language.
9 of the original 13 are found
in primates' (and some
unexpected animals')
interactions, while the other
four are unique to humans.
Some of these features are
quite obvious:
To have a language, there must
be a channel on which to
communicate. Often
that is a vocal/auditory
channel, but it could just as
easily be visual/written,
or physical/visual.
To have a language, meaning
must be tied to the sounds,
symbols or actions
of the language. We would not
be able to communicate if
there did not exist some
understanding of meaning
between speaker and listener.
Less obvious are features like
Interchangeability,
Displacement, and
Prevarication.
In order:
Interchangeability
describes the idea that any
member of a language
community can convey any part
of the language regardless of
the veracity of the
statement. For example, I can
easily say "I am in Spain" at
the same time as "I
am in Russia." Neither are
correct, there is not an
inherent linguistic
restriction preventing me from
saying either one. This
feature is not seen in
some animal languages. Ant
queens secrete a unique
chemical compound to express
meaning to the hive, since no
other ants can synthesize that
compound, there is
not interchangeability in the
ants' communication. This
feature is the
embodiment of a lack of
authentication. Our ability to
communicate falsehoods
(by meaning) stems from the
lack of authentication needed
to create a statement.
If we communicated with
pheromones like the ants do,
it might be impossible for
me to say "I am female" since
the language itself restricts
my ability to
deceive. *rough*
    Humans are special in that
we can discuss concepts and
topics of distant or
imaginary content. It is with
no difficulty that a reader
can imagine an
elephant parading while
wearing a small hat, despite
having most likely never
actually seen one in real
life. Displacement is our
ability to address these
things not in our physical
presence. There are some
animals which have the
ability to "relay" displaced
information, for example
howler monkeys have been
observed sharing warning cries
from other monkeys despite not
being in the
physical presence of danger
itself, however displacement
in the general sense is
thought to be unique (on
Earth) to human languages.
Finally, Prevarication
(literally "a violation of
duty" from Latin) is the
ability to lie. Built on the
idea of no language level
authentication and
displacement, it is possible
for anyone to speak false
about anything --
regardless of direct
connection or the speaker's
real knowledge.

The discussion and motivation
up to this point in my writing
has not been
subtle. Deception in our
language is inherent in its
design; being a
(programming) language
enthusiast(?), this flaw is
hard for me to accept. So I
would like to examine what our
language could look like under
different
circumstances. A world without
Interchangeability,
Displacement, Prevarication
or some combination of those.


Future points:

It is easy to believe the
world we interact directly
with; there is no doubt
that the chair you are sitting
in is as real as you are.




What if we need a new language
for communication -- a
language that has
authentication, privacy,
integrity and confidentiality
(the four pillars of
security).
There are two definitions of
authentication which could be
used here. First,
that it is possible to
authenticate that a message
came from the expected
sender. This is the
traditional sense of
authentication used in
computer
science. A second, stronger
restriction could be placed on
the language
requiring that the content of
a message must be verifiable
of the sender. This
goal is most likely not
attainable due to the
complexity of what we need to
discuss in language. As
described above, displacement
is a necessary feature of
language -- without it we
would hardly be different than
chimpanzees in
linguistic ability.
