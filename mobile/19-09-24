Words and their trivial
meanings.

The purpose of a word or any
other collection of sounds is
to convert knowledge from one
user to understanding in
another.
Towards this end, a word is
only meaningful if both users
share a definition, and
perhaps more importantly can
both map the same definition
to the given context.
These premisses are used when
talking about the colloquial
idea of language, also
referred to as descriptive
linguistics.
With descriptive linguistics,
it is perfectly reasonable to
talk about "non-words" and
misused words.
A collection of sounds
(phonemes) such as Lewis
Carol's "vorpal" might not
exist in any English speakers'
vocabulary, however that won't
stop Carol from bringing the
word to life in his poem. We,
the readers, are forced to
create a new mapping for
vorpal from the context in
which it is used. Notably,
many of the definitions people
will imagine for vorpal will
be different. The word will be
used differently among
different sets of people,
which leads to dissonance in
the language.
To counteract the creative
force of language, committies
create dictionaries with the
express purpose of mapping
words to a set of "official"
definitions, such that anyone
may consult the dictionary
when confused on how a word is
used in any context.

It would be a mistake would be
to assume that the
dictionaries themselves are
what give meaning to words.
Prescriptivist linguists,
however, fall precisely into
this fallacy.
To a prescriptivist, language
is a set of strict rules and
strict mappings from words to
meaning, with little to no
flexibility. It is improper
grammar, they would argue, to
foolishly split an infinitive.
Using a non-word would
similarly violate the bounds
of their strict vocabularly.
These are the people who
aren't exciting at dinner
parties.

Adopting a prescriptivist
mentality is akin to standing
still with your eyes closed
and yelling at those around
you for looking.
Language is a beautiful
flowing entity which cannot be
confined to rigid rules.
Meanings change with time;
grammar evolves.

The descriptive idea of
language is not without its
faults though. When two people
believe they have a shared
definition of a word, they
might indeed have two entirely
different understandings of
the word. The result is either
that the word looses its
meaning entirely, in which
case the communication has
broken down and needs to be
reestablished by the
communicating parties, or that
the communication itself
fails, and the knowledge has
not been correctly understood
by the receiver.

All of this to say, leather is
both a fabric and not a
fabric, depending on the
collection of people in the
conversation and each of their
own understandings of the word
fabric.
(Future: Words exist in a
quantum state, where until
they have been explicitly
defined by each party their
meanings are uncertain.)
