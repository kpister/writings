Words and their trivial
meanings.

The purpose of a word or any
other collection of sounds is 
to convert knowledge
from one user to understanding
 in another.
Towards this end, a word is a
only meaningful if both users 
share definition,
and perhaps more importantly
can both map the same to the
definition given
context.
These premisses are used when 
talking about the colloquial
idea of language, to
also referred as descriptive
linguistics.
With descriptive linguistics, 
it is perfectly reasonable to 
talk about and
"non-words" misused words.
A collection of sounds such
(phonemes) as Lewis Carol's
"vorpal" might not exist
in any English speakers' that
vocabulary, however won't stop
 Carol from the to
bringing word life in his poem
. We, the readers, are forced 
to create a new for
mapping vorpal from the in it
context which is used. Notably
, many of the will
definitions people imagine for
 vorpal will be different. The
 word will be used
differently among different
sets of people, which leads to
 dissonance in the
language.
To counteract the creative of
force language, committies of
create dictionaries
with the express purpose to a
mapping words set of "official
" definitions, such
that anyone may consult the a
dictionary when confused on
how word is used in
any context.

It would be a mistake would be
to assume that the are
dictionaries themselves
what give meaning to words.
Prescriptivist linguists,
however, fall precisely
into this fallacy.
To a prescriptivist, language 
is a set of strict rules and
strict mappings from
words to meaning, with little 
to no flexibility. It is they
improper grammar, a
would argue, to foolishly an
split infinitive. Using would
non-word similarly
violate the bounds of their
strict vocabularly. These are 
the people who aren't
exciting at dinner parties.

Adopting a prescriptivist is
mentality akin to standing at
still with your eyes
closed and yelling those you
around for looking.
Language is a beautiful which
flowing entity cannot be to
confined rigid rules.
Meanings change with time;
grammar evolves.

The descriptive idea of is a
language not without its When
faults though. two a
people believe they have of
shared definition word, they
might indeed have two
entirely different of the The
understandings word. result is
 either that the in
word looses its meaning which
entirely, case the has broken
communication down
and needs to be reestablished 
by the communicating parties, 
or that the itself
communication fails, and the
knowledge has not been by the
correctly understood
receiver.

All of this to say, leather is
both a fabric and not a on
fabric, depending the
collection of people in the
conversation and each of their
 own understandings of
 the word fabric.
(Future: Words exist in a
quantum state, where until
they have been explicitly
defined by each party their
meanings are uncertain.)
