Book Report #1.

Since starting at Epic in
October, I have become a
prolific reader.
In the course of 15 weeks, I
have read/listened to more
than 25 books ranging from pop
science, to science fiction to
philosophy.

My journey has largely been
guided by recommendations from
friends and family - it turns
out everyone has an opinion on
what you should be reading!

The simple two-note system I
used to start (tracking books
I want to read and books I
have read) worked at the
start, and indeed I do
continue to update it.
However my ambitions for
documenting my reading stretch
beyond Notes. From a typical
academically focused mindset,
I want to share what I learn.
To an extent, goodreads.com
satisfies this goal, but I am
always going to support a
choice that I have more
control over.
For that reason, I am planning
on creating a website which I
can tailor to my exact needs.
I'm sure that it won't be a
sophisticated as something
like goodreads, and I am
certain that a million other
blogs like it will exist, but
that is not my point. This is
my blog. There are many like
it, but this one is mine.

With that said, I cannot
generate a blog I am happy
with overnight, and instead
will use these writings as my
medium in tempore.

## The books I've read since
October 2019

1. 7 Habits of Successful
People
    Author: Stephen Covey

    Rating: 2 - it was okay.

I would not recommend 7
Habits to most people. It is
the type of novel that teaches
you simple empathy and calls
it revolutionizing.
While I can see that many
people can benefit from
empathizing more, I think
there are better ways to learn
than from a 300 page story
book.
    Covey lived an interesting
life and has plenty of
anecdotes that fit nicely into
the themes that he pushes, but
in almost every scenario the
point is belabored and could
be culled down to a paragraph
or two.
The book did come at a
time of change for me, and I
value the perspective it gave
me on how relationships should
work.

2. Space Cadet
    Author: Robert Heinlein

Rating: 4 - really liked
it.

The first sci-fi novel
I've read in quite some time,
Space Cadet is part of
Heinlein's Juvenile's series.
A beautifully simple and easy
read.
I enjoyed Space Cadet in
particular _because_ of its
simplicity. It is the type of
novel you can pick up and
finish in an afternoon.

3. 2001: A Space Odyssey
    Author: Arthur Clarke

    Rating: 3 - liked it.

Coming off the back of
Space Cadet, I figured I
should explore some more
sci-fi and see what all my
father's hype is about.
2001 has a compelling
story, but I couldn't stand
the introductory exposition.
The description of the
evolution of man towards some
outer species projection is so
fundamentally human centric it
breaks its own logic.
I wanted HAL to take more
space as well. There were many
allusions towards HAL's goals,
but this thread didn't spin
into anything I found
interesting. I noticed the
same problem with a future
Heinlein book, The Moon is a
Harsh Mistress, but we'll get
to that in a bit.
    Overall, was definitely an
enjoyable read.

4. Starship Troopers
    Author: Robert Heinlein

Rating: 4 - really liked
it. On the upper end of 4.

    Everything about the Space
Cadet which I liked, the
simple action, lovable and
daring characters, wild sci-fi
thought experiments and thinly
veiled political beliefs are
exposed in beautiful detail
with Starship troopers.
The novel does exactly
what I would want from a map
function which takes in a
young adult novel and outputs
a (normal adult) novel.
Details are expanded is such a
perfect way that you don't
mind the extra pages.
I would happily read
Starship Troopers-esque novels
all day long.
    It has been the star of my
current knowledge of the
sci-fi genre and I would
recommend it to anyone looking
for light reading or a good
novel.
