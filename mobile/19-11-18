Random Musings of the past
month

Since I have hardly written in
the past month, I've instead
collected ideas and questions
I would like to explore in
future writings.
I don't have the knowledge or
the developed ideas to expand
on these ideas yet, but I want
to put them down to ponder
later.
Ideally, this will be an
extension of the notepad I
keep on my phone with one or
two sentences.

1. I don't want to reinvent
the wheel but I do want to see
why the wheel was invented.
Most all of my true
knowledge stems from an
understanding of fundamental
ideas and problems.
When I see what was,
understanding what _is_
becomes much more intuitive.
    Every step we take forward
is often quite clear and
logical, but when viewed from
5,000 feet, the path becomes
difficult to follow.
Our schooling primarily
follows a structure that
requires students to believe
something works because that's
the way it is.
There is little chance to
explore _how_ ancient
scientists and mathematicians
discovered their works.
    I believe a paradigm shift
in schooling towards _how_
would dramatically improve
comprehension and excitement
in school.
Students would have the
opportunity to experience
learning as a discovery not as
rote memorization.
Imagining history as
though you were there to make
the choices would imbue
students with not only a
greater understanding of the
difficulties people of
previous times went through
but a greater sense of empathy
towards those around them
today.

2. The benefits of indexing
knowledge versus knowing
knowledge.
    Today we have the greatest
index ever available to
humankind in the form of
Google.
Provided you have access
to the Internet, the average
human can answer almost any
question.
This is undoubtedly an
improvement over the past -
there are plenty of cognitive
science question to be asked
here, but you are hard pressed
to argue that wider spread
access to knowledge is a bad
thing.
More interesting to me is
my own (and by extension
others') educational
practices.
    Should I focus on learning
an index on the material I
read and interact with such
that I would be able to
quickly find the answers that
I need, or should I focus on
retaining exact details from
that same content.
The obvious advantage of
indexing would be a
compression of knowledge down
to a single point of access.
Provided I have access to
whatever material I have
identified contains the answer
to my question, and I have the
time to locate the answer in
that material, I only need a
small amount of mental space
to capture the idea.
On the other hand,
retaining the entire idea in
my head may take more space
but require significantly less
time (an no direct resource
requirement) to access.
    Furthermore, I would argue
that having the knowledge in
your head often means that you
have a stronger grasp of the
ideas or have wrestled with
them beyond a first pass.
An encyclopedia is of
course a wonderful tool, but
that is not the point of human
thought.
We live our lives to be
critical thinkers solving
complex, deep problems.
The shallow form of
thought that indexing promotes
is hardly useful to that end.
    *Except* in trying to form
connections between different
ideas. Being able to see a lot
of small endpoints (indices)
from a zoomed out view would
certainly make connecting
large graphs of knowledge much
easier. Conversely, deep
knowledge of few topics would
be easier to connect a smaller
graph.

3. I want to create a content
recommendation system.
This is not a project for
other people so much as for
myself.
    It would provide a way for
me to track the things I am
enjoying and reflect on them
in the same space.
Similar to this writing
project, I think it would
expand my borders to something
new.
And who knows, maybe
someone would benefit from it.
    My idea would be to review
books or podcasts, tv shows,
games, programming languages,
food. Anything that I interact
with one a regular basis and
have an opinion on.

I'll leave this entry here.
The rest of these thoughts
will be filled in at a later
date.
The ideas mentioned here will
hopefully be expanded into
full pieces at some point.
