Talking with people

In many Pokemon games, it is
impossible to pass beyond the
second town without talking to
the required NPCs. I don't
mean the NPCs that are part of
the storyline, the ones that
you are *told* to talk to, I
mean the people living in a
house that provide you with
the Cut HM, or the ones that
give you a side quest so that
they stop blocking your path.

Pokemon uses these early NPCs
to teach the player that there
are rewards for exploring the
map. Not only visiting a town
to find new Pokemon and
Trainers, but also to meet a
new group of people - some
might give you quests, some
might give you advice, and
some are completely useless.
The diverse nature of these
NPCs builds out the world into
something more than just a
single play-through quest; it
makes a customizable story.

The phenomenon is not unique
to Pokemon, most any well
developed RPG will invest some
level of detail on the
characters that your player
will interact with serving
similar roles to the Pokemon
NPCs above.

Of course, the real world
mimics good video games.
Meeting and talking with new
people, people who aren't
friends or family creates all
sorts of possibilities. As
someone who has recently moved
to a new town, I feel
connected to my previous
Pokemon games - searching for
people to help me or give me
advice. On my first day, I've
talked with many different
people, people I could have
ignored instead, and as a
result I received a free ride
to my destination, a discount
on my climbing membership, and
information about a game store
I wouldn't have otherwise.

My point here is that I could
spend my time in a new town
progressing like a single
player RPG ignoring those
around me and just trying to
get through to my next
mainline story checkpoint, or
I could invest in the area and
do some side quests! Who
knows, they might even help me
in my main quest down the
road.
