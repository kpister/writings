I like writing privately.
There is a sense of serenity
that comes with knowing no one
other than a very select
selected few will get to see
these words.
But I post this publicly to
Github for anyone in the world
to read. You might say, "But
Kaiser, no one will read
this." Which is fair, I expect
the average viewer count per
piece written here to be under
one (myself included).
Part of the enjoyment for me
is the public exploration of
my mind. I am not ashamed of
my flaws, I recognize them,
and attempt to improve upon
them but only from a self
improvement point of view.
My writing ability, for
example, has always been a
weakness - I know this is a
flaw of mine and it was
something I used to be ashamed
of, but that didn't get me
anywhere! My shame prevented
me from writing instead of
pushing me to write more.

I have been ashamed of my
appearance. I've had perpetual
acne since I was 13, and while
I never gave it too much
thought it has always been a
detriment to my personal
image. But my shame around
acne got me nowhere.
Acceptance is what has brought
me to the dermatologist.
Acceptance is what brings
change.
I'm done letting my fear drive
me.

That is why I am writing
publicly. I want to confront
my fear of other people's
judgement head on.
