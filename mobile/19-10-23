Writing process

This is my writing process. It
is a flawed workflow.
Something I am looking to
improve and iterate upon with
more practice.

1. Idea floats to mind
This can happen
spontaneously or as a reaction
to something I've read to
experienced. A lot of the
pieces I am most interested in
are from the first category,
but occasionally I feel the
urge to write a reaction
piece.
2. Make a note on my phone
All of the topics I write
about come from notes on my
phone. Often I'll write a
single line, maybe on a
complex topic I'll add in a
few lines of description to
describe why I thought the
thought or what circumstance I
was in so that I can recreate
the scene mentally as I write.
3. Begin writing from stream
of conciousness on my laptop
in Vim.
For the most part I start
with a title and write what
comes to my mind as it comes
to my mind striving for the
goal of just putting thoughts
to the page over creating
something readable. I see this
process as analogous to the
memory urn that Dumbledore
uses in Harry Potter. I am
putting my wand to my head and
extracting a thought - much
better than I would ever do
internally.

There are a couple steps I
would like to add to this
process.
The most important stages I am
missing are steps 4,5, and 6
which are all "Editing." From
the start I've been meaning to
review past writings and
iterate upon them, fixing
confusing ideas, clarifying
what would otherwise be seen
as random connections.
Rephrasing awkward sentencing
and the like.
I also want to add a step
between 2 and 3 which would be
planning. I think that a lot
of these pieces have almost
just become the planning
stage, but they would all
benefit from a more structured
guideline, a roadmap. That
said, I do enjoy the stream of
conciousness style of writing
and would keep it for the
outlining phase or even some
full pieces.

The limiting factor for me
feels like time. I don't have
the time to always be editing
or planning pieces. I normally
spend at most 15 minutes a day
writing if I even get to that,
but I think that in order to
progress it is a necessary
investment.

Writing is undoubtedly worth
it. I am sure I'll feel the
same about editing (especially
because I often enjoy editing
more than writing itself).
