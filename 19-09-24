Words and their trivial meanings.

The purpose of a word or any other collection of sounds is to convert knowledge
from one user to understanding in another.
Towards this end, a word is only meaningful if both users share a definition,
and perhaps more importantly can both map the same definition to the given
context.
These premisses are used when talking about the colloquial idea of language,
also referred to as descriptive linguistics.
With descriptive linguistics, it is perfectly reasonable to talk about
"non-words" and misused words.
A collection of sounds (phonemes) such as Lewis Carol's "vorpal" might not exist
in any English speakers' vocabulary, however that won't stop Carol from bringing
the word to life in his poem. We, the readers, are forced to create a new
mapping for vorpal from the context in which it is used. Notably, many of the
definitions people will imagine for vorpal will be different. The word will be
used differently among different sets of people, which leads to dissonance in
the language.
To counteract the creative force of language, committies create dictionaries
with the express purpose of mapping words to a set of "official" definitions,
such that anyone may consult the dictionary when confused on how a word is used
in any context.

It would be a mistake would be to assume that the dictionaries themselves are
what give meaning to words. Prescriptivist linguists, however, fall precisely
into this fallacy.
To a prescriptivist, language is a set of strict rules and strict mappings from
words to meaning, with little to no flexibility. It is improper grammar, they
would argue, to foolishly split an infinitive. Using a non-word would similarly
violate the bounds of their strict vocabularly. These are the people who aren't
exciting at dinner parties.

Adopting a prescriptivist mentality is akin to standing still with your eyes
closed and yelling at those around you for looking.
Language is a beautiful flowing entity which cannot be confined to rigid rules.
Meanings change with time; grammar evolves.

The descriptive idea of language is not without its faults though. When two
people believe they have a shared definition of a word, they might indeed have
two entirely different understandings of the word. The result is either that the
word looses its meaning entirely, in which case the communication has broken
down and needs to be reestablished by the communicating parties, or that the
communication itself fails, and the knowledge has not been correctly understood
by the receiver.

All of this to say, leather is both a fabric and not a fabric, depending on the
collection of people in the conversation and each of their own understandings of
the word fabric.
(Future: Words exist in a quantum state, where until they have been explicitly
defined by each party their meanings are uncertain.)
