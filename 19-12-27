Some New Year's Resolutions.

New Year's resolutions are cheesy. We set plans and goals which are unattainable
or idealistic based on the people we wish we were instead of thinking about the
people we are.
A goal inspires, but an idealistic goal which we fail at can actually be a
burden. We let lofty ideals frighten us into inaction.

Instead, this year I am projecting my 2019 forward, towards post-holiday season.
The holidays are always a busy time of year, and some habits and hobbies slip
through the cracks.
By looking at the end of 2019 and reflecting on the activities I've enjoyed but
let go, I think I'll have a more realistic and engaging list of "resolutions"
for the new year.

I do not intend for this list to be comprehensive nor binding.
It will be a list of things that I am interested in pursuing through the next
year, time permitting, with an explanation of the goal and motivations behind
it.

1. Write weekly.
Writing has been such a screen into my mind, one that I love to watch. I
want to write at least once a week, ideally almost daily to exercise my writing
skills as well as my personal reflection and my thought processes.

2. Meditate Daily.
In a similar vein to writing meditation has brought me a lot of spiritual
connection. My mind, energy and emotions have never felt more in sync. I'd like
to maintain a relatively consistent meditation schedule.

3. Read constantly.
In the later half of 2019, I was able to read 14 books in a little over 10
weeks. Setting a lofty goal like the 52 book challenge sounds fun, and I'll
attempt it, however I do not feel burdened by this specific goal.

4. Cook a new recipe every week.
Each week I want to push myself to try creating something new, baking or
cooking, at home for myself or friends. Looking into new cuisines will give me
the opportunity to expand my kitchen and cooking abilities!

5. Focusing on being healthy. 
Body health is important!
