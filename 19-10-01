Take a breath

Taking it slow is fine. A slow drip carves caverns.

A slow continuous process will result in a much better experience for you. We
are all told to rush. Rush through the arbitrary hoops set around us. Passing
through this hoop or that will bring you so much closer to the ever receding
goal. I believe that instead we should do our best to dance through the hoops we
resonate with. Push forward on what drives you, and only what drives you, at
your own pace. There are too many facets and nuggets of this world to be
constrained to the common path.

Breathe. 

The transformation from age 10 to 20 is magnificent. The changes between 22 and
23 are fantastic! Preserve that dynamic above all. Dynamic motion is what makes
life interesting and worth living - not the pace at which we "progress."
Everyone has the potential to change, and change constantly. But we fear that we
cannot, somehow all of our changing time is behind us.
