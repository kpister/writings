# Titles are dying with the next generation

While the previous generations place large importance on their titles and
distinctions, it has become much more socially appealing to display yourself as
a humble commoner.
We try to be the cool kids, and don't seek to elevate ourselves above those
without the same title.
Actions speak far louder than words in the age when everything can be displayed.
Historically, the only way to convey one's prestige was through the
acknoledgement of others, being knighted and graduation were testiments from a
trusted organization that you passed some set of qualifications. These titles
show that others believe in you.
Now that anyone can publicly display everything they can do online, it is much
less important to have testiment from others.
The titles become irrelevant. 
Your credibility comes from your actions and not others.
Reputation will be earned, not given. 

This is a good thing. A future without titles leads to greater equality and
better treatment of all, not just those who were fortunate enough to find
someone to bestow a title.
In some ways this will be the democratization of prestige. The Internet allows
for a proof of competency.

However, with this idea comes the same set of issues present with all other
benefits of the Internet. We can lie, trick, and confuse larger masses of people
through the information found on the web.
One solution around this is Content Curation as a Service (CCaaS), which looks
to find reputable information and disseminate that to followers much the same as
news of the 20th century did. These CCaaSs provide specific insights into what
they believe to be relevant, and often provide brief descriptions or reasoning
behind each topic mentioned.
This solution circles back to the current title'd approach. We will delegate to
certain establishments or people to do our fact checking, and accredidation for
us, to save us the work of doing it ourselves.
This is effectively transfer the burden of titling to these CCaaSs, as opposed
to Universities or monarchs. Despite this, we will potentially still have a big
win. It is significantly easier for multiple CCaaSs to accredit a single author,
painter, thinker than for multiple universities. Drawing upon ideas from
distributed systems, we can see this as attempting to find consensus among
multiple sources instead of a single monolithic source.
Familiar to some, the Stellar Consensus Protocol allows for an individual who
trusts some small subset of all CCaaS to establish consensus on the
creditability of a source through quorum slices of the whole network of CCaaS.

It is at this point that I see I have diverged significantly from the original
idea of the writing session, but can't help but to think this is a legitimate
idea.
