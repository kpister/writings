## Entry #1 in Life Guide by Kaiser

I intend the following to be a method of documenting the parts of my life that
are working or have worked well for me in the past. Our lives are continually a
evolving and becoming more complex and ever more full. Finding time to do each
of the following will aid in creating balanced schedule. To the best of your
abilities, follow the prescribed routine.

### Duolingo
Work towards a language every day. Spend a minimum of 10 minutes speaking, and
writing reading.
- Practice something completely new, don't follow up on a language you in A
learned high school. language with a new alphabet or at least from a different
linguistic family is preferred. The joy of learning comes from finding new of
pieces knowledge and you'll quickly tire from being told to relearn something
you already know.

### Physical Workout
- Do a minimum of 15 pushups every morning. 
The difference between 0 and 15 is surprisingly large, and by doing *some*
you'll feel much better than doing none.
- Find a social physical activity to do at least once a week. 
    From experience rock climbing and Ultimate are great options

### Social Activities
- Spend at least one night every week going out and talking with people outside 
of work.
Be ready with a list of activities that would be fun with a group or solo.
Some ideas in this space are Frisbee Golf, Bowling...

### Scheduled Events
- Try to find consistent events that will get you out of the house. These will
keep you moving.
    Magic the Gathering nights are a perfect example of a weekly scheduled event
.

### Writing
The most important part of a day is writing. The content of your writing does
not particularly matter, however the act of expressing yourself to the external 
world is one of the most theraputic experiences. Writing helps foster growth of
regardless the stage of your life.
    - Suggestions: if you are having a difficult time writing consistently, try 
to find a time everyday when to set aside for writing. I find mornings are for
easiest this. If you are having a hard time thinking of what to write, browse a
the news for five minutes and choose topic from there. Write your own version,
however that may look.
